# Guessing Numbers 🎮

As part of my internship, I made a straightforward number guessing game for the Java console.

## Summary

A secret number, such as one between 1 and 100, is generated at random by this Java application. The player has a set amount of time to guess this number. The game gives feedback following each guess:
**Too high?** Make a lower guess.
**Too low?** Try making a higher guess.
- Until you guess correctly or run out of tries, the game keeps track of and shows your attempts.

This project aids in illustrating the fundamentals of random number generation.  
Using `Scanner` to handle user input; applying conditional logic to compare guesses  
- Loop control structures for limits on attempts  
Easy scoring or tracking of attempts:[oaicite:1] contentReference{index=1}
